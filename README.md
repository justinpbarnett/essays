# Justin's Essays
In the age of AI and short-term entertainment, critical thinking skills are eroding rapidly. This collection of essays will be a remedy where I practice thinking through tough and interesting questions.

## How to use this repo
1. Ideas get added as a new [issue](https://github.com/justinpbarnett/essays/issues). Here I can add relevant notes and references as comments as I come across them.
2. When I'm ready to start a new essay, create a new .md file with a short essay title in kebab case (ex `why-roman-empire-fell.md`).
3. Reference the created file via link the relevant issue.
4. Edit the file in a text editor using Jordan Peterson's essay writing system and make regular commits.

## How to write an essay
1. **Topic:** Choose a topic that's interesting and frame it as a question.
2. **Reading:** Read and take notes on 5-10 books/articles per 1,000 words (see [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) for articles).
3. **Outline:** Create a 10-15 sentence outline with each sentence framed as a question. Points can have sub-points.
4. **Bad Draft:** Write a 10-15 sentence paragraph per point. No editing. Overshoot word count by 25%.
5. **Edit:** Each word should be the exact right word and in the right place in the sentence. Each sentence should be a complete thought and in the right order in the paragraph. Each paragraph should be ~10 sentences or ~100 words and should be in the right order in the essay. The essay itself should be interesting or important within the current culture.
6. **Rewrite:** Space each sentence onto its own line and rewite it below until it cannot be any better. Re-order the paragraphs again.
7. **Reconstruct:** Reconstruct the outline from memory to screen for the important points. Port over the existing paragraphs to fit this new outline and adjust content and order as needed.
8. **Re-rewrite:** Go through each sentence again to make sure each cannot possibly be better.
9. **Done:** The essay is complete when the words, sentences, and paragraphs cannot be nor be ordered better.
10. **Format:** Properly format the essay and add in the complete bibliography.

## Notes
- Everything goes in master branch for simplicity since it's just me who will be using this repo.
- The goal of having everything saved here is to encourge more thoughfulness and intentionality, not perfection.
- There is no limit to how small or large the essays have to be. They could be a mini one-paragraph thought or an entire novel.
- Multiple essays can be worked on in parallel.
- Once I start an essay, it must be finished. This is to develop the habbit of completing things. Starting a new essay will be a heavier choice because of this requirement.
